# My_Application
This project aims to develop a speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion application for emails. 
The application will be developed for visually impaired people. Therefore, user interaction will be managed over speech instructions. 
There will be no Graphical User Interface no buttons and etc. User will be asked by application to “say” certain keywords for different actions like sending an email or listing received emails.
